Decomposition allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts that can be addressed independently. Abstraction allows you to hide the internal complexities of an object and expose only the necessary information. The ability to create reusable code blocks through functions is a key component of OOP. This lesson lays the groundwork for designing and implementing well-structured, modular, and reusable object-oriented code.",
