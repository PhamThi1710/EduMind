          "explanation": "This lesson is critical because it introduces fundamental concepts for understanding and implementing algorithms. Recursion is frequently used in sorting algorithms, especially divide-and-conquer approaches like Merge Sort and Quick Sort. Understanding complexity analysis is directly relevant to the student's goal, as it enables them to evaluate the efficiency of their implementations and meet the 90% correctness requirement. Without a solid grasp of recursion and complexity, implementing and optimizing sorting and searching algorithms effectively is very difficult.",
