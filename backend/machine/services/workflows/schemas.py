    Used to represent the relationship between a learning resource and its related concepts.
    
    Attributes:
        difficulty (float): Represents the difficulty level of the concept in relation to the learning resource. 
            Higher values indicate a more challenging concept, helping tailor resource recommendations to learnersâ€™ proficiency levels.
        relevance (float): Indicates how closely related or essential the concept is to the learning resource. 
            Higher values suggest a core concept, while lower values might indicate supplementary or less central concepts.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the parameters. Here is an example:
        {
            "concept": "",
            "difficulty": 0.8,
